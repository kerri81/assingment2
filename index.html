               I am a mother of 3 children, step mum of 3 and nana of 3. I am currently a maritime security guard living in Adelaide. I have been working in the security industry for the last 14 years doing access control, crowd control, patient minding, fire warden, alarm response etc. My hobbies include reading, studying and day to day administration of privately-owned air-conditioning company. At 15 years old, I worked collaboratively with a friend as IT monitors for new school computer room. Duties included software installation, software maintenance, PC monitoring, mentor teachers in new applications for report usage. I was in this role for 12 months but lost interest and pursued other careers. I have basic IT knowledge and experience apart from some which I have learnt in my employment. My ideal job is a financial controller, as I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Financial Planning, I’ve always had an avid interest in finance / accounting.

                 I have been caring for someone who has been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). In order to be better prepared for such a task, I am completing a Bachelor of Psychological Science. As part of my research, I am studying at RMIT to have a better understanding of Information Technology security. Such security is essential if I am to protect my patient effectively.

            <p class="about">    
                I grew up on Norfolk Island before moving to the Mid-North Coast of NSW where I went to primary and high school. I am now 19 years old and living in Brisbane with one of my three siblings. I have worked in retail at Coles Supermarkets since September 2016 and have supervised at the service desk since the beginning of 2018. My hobbies include gaming (both video and board games), reading and playing guitar. My interest in IT began when I was 12 after ‘Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure’ was released, it featured Near Field Communication (NFC) which allowed figurines to be placed on a platform and used within the game. This got me interested in IT and specifically game design.  I own a phone, a PC and a console, but other than that I have a very limited experience in the IT field outside a few failed game creations.

            <p class="about">    
               I am 24 year old woman, who is struggling to obtain a full time job. I currently reside in the south-east side of brisbane and I work part time in Big W as a Sales Associate. I currently live at home with my mother. My hobbies include reading, gaming, coding and binge watching netflix whilst working and applying for jobs and studying for the course. My interest in IT first started when my mother brought home a N64 at the age of 8. This nurtured the need to achieve goals that I have to work towards and pour my hard work and time into. This in turn developed into finding out how the world worked around me and being involved with the IT aspect, I turned towards website coding. I am adamantly trying to obtain a job as a website developer as this is my ideal job. I currently own 2 laptops and a ps2 through to 4. I am very limited in the professional IT field but I have created a fair few websites, both with and without databases.
